# 4. Adopt Apple Liquid Glass Design

Date: 2025-06-27

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to modernize our mobile application's visual design language to provide a more contemporary and platform-native user experience. Apple has introduced new liquid glass design principles that offer:

- Enhanced visual depth and hierarchy through translucent surfaces
- Improved readability with dynamic background blurring
- Better integration with iOS design patterns and system components
- Modern aesthetic that aligns with current design trends
- Potential performance optimizations through system-level rendering

Our current design system lacks the visual sophistication and platform integration that users expect from modern iOS applications. Adopting Apple's liquid glass design could significantly improve user engagement and provide a more polished experience.

## Decision

We propose to adopt Apple's new liquid glass design system for our mobile application, including:

- Implementation of translucent backgrounds with dynamic blur effects
- Integration of vibrancy effects for text and UI elements over liquid glass surfaces
- Adoption of liquid glass cards and panels for content organization
- Use of system-provided liquid glass materials where available
- Custom liquid glass implementations for unique design requirements

This would involve:
- Updating our design tokens to include liquid glass specifications
- Modifying existing UI components to support liquid glass backgrounds
- Implementing proper contrast and accessibility considerations for liquid glass surfaces
- Creating fallback designs for devices that don't support advanced liquid glass effects

## Consequences

### Positive
- Modern, visually appealing interface that feels native to iOS
- Improved visual hierarchy and content organization
- Better integration with iOS system design language
- Potential performance benefits from system-optimized rendering
- Enhanced user experience and perceived app quality
- Future-proofing for upcoming iOS design evolution

### Negative
- Increased development complexity for liquid glass effect implementations
- Potential performance impact on older devices
- Need for extensive testing across different device capabilities
- Accessibility challenges with text readability over dynamic backgrounds
- Learning curve for design and development teams
- Possible increased battery usage due to visual effects

### Risks
- Liquid glass effects may not be available on all target iOS versions
- Performance degradation on lower-end devices
- Accessibility compliance challenges with dynamic backgrounds
- Inconsistent rendering across different screen technologies

### Mitigation
- Implement progressive enhancement with fallbacks for unsupported devices
- Conduct thorough accessibility testing and provide high-contrast alternatives
- Performance testing across target device range
- Gradual rollout starting with key UI components
- Team training on liquid glass design principles and implementation
- Establish clear guidelines for appropriate use of liquid glass effects
