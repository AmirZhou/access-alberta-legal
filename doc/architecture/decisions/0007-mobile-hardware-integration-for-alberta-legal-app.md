Date: 2025-06-30

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Access Alberta Legal mobile app needs hardware integration to provide location-based legal services, accessibility features, and document management for Alberta residents.

## Decision

Integrate 5 key hardware components:
- **GPS**: Find nearby legal clinics, courthouses, provide directions
- **Speaker**: Text-to-speech for accessibility, voice-guided navigation
- **Microphone**: Voice search, dictation, voice notes
- **Camera**: Document scanning, QR codes, evidence photos
- **Network**: Real-time legal data, court schedules, secure communications

Implementation phases: 1) GPS + Network, 2) Camera, 3) Audio features

## Consequences

**Positive**: Enhanced accessibility, location-based help, document capture, real-time data
**Negative**: Privacy concerns, battery impact, permission complexity, platform differences
**Mitigations**: Local data processing, HTTPS encryption, graceful permission handling, offline fallbacks
