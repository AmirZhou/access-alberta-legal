# 3. Choose OKLCH as our color system

Date: 2025-06-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a consistent color system for our application that provides:
- Perceptually uniform color spaces for better accessibility
- Predictable color manipulation and interpolation
- Better support for wide gamut displays
- Improved color consistency across different devices and browsers

Traditional color systems like HSL and RGB have limitations in perceptual uniformity, making it difficult to create accessible color palettes and smooth color transitions.

## Decision

We will adopt OKLCH (OK Lightness Chroma Hue) as our primary color system for:
- Defining color tokens in our design system
- Color manipulation and generation functions
- CSS custom properties and color calculations
- Accessibility compliance calculations

OKLCH provides:
- Perceptually uniform lightness values
- Consistent chroma (colorfulness) across different hues
- Better interpolation results for gradients and animations
- Improved accessibility calculations for contrast ratios

## Consequences

### Positive
- More predictable and accessible color palettes
- Smoother color transitions and gradients
- Better support for programmatic color generation
- Future-proof for wide gamut displays
- Improved accessibility compliance

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with OKLCH
- Limited browser support requires fallbacks for older browsers
- Tooling and design software may have limited OKLCH support
- Need to establish conversion utilities for legacy color values

### Mitigation
- Provide team training on OKLCH concepts
- Implement fallback color values for browser compatibility
- Create utility functions for color conversions
- Document color system usage guidelines
